# Alumni Tracking System

This is our graduation project for software engineering major in king saud university in 2020.

In this project we created Alumni Tracking System which can be used by education institutes to
help them enhance the education curriculum for their study programs , and this thing can happen
by : 
| Step | How ? |
| ------ | ------ |
| Enhance the communication between the alumni and the administration of the college | Creating chat in our system |
| Make survey's to be answered by alumni | Add survey functionality into our system |
| Getting the market must demanded skills | Get the alumni to be able to add experiences in the app after their graduation |

* And these things can help us in imporving our programs contents.

It was done by :
* Ahmad Almelaifi : [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-almelaifi-541a72170/)

* Mohammed Bin Khunin: [Email](mailto:m.rashed.k@hotmail.com )

## Tech
The frameworks and programming languages we used in our application is the following :-
* Mobile application : **Flutter framework**
* Web application : **PHP**
* Database : **MySQL**
* Web application Statistics : **ReactJS**

And this is how we managed our app
| Task | Tech Used |
| ------ | ------ |
| Managing Database | phpMyAdmin |
| Password Encryption | SHA1 |
| Package to manage SQL Database on Flutter | MySQL1 |

* The time taken to develop this system was 3 months which was **Challenge**.
* Also you will notice our system is mostly based on **Object Oriented Programming** which will make it easier to **Maintain the Codebase.**
* The system is not fully completed and need only to be integrated "mobile and web app" + It needs more testing and fixing bugs.
